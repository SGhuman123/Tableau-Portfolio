Here are what I learnt in the various sections:


- Section 2:
  - In this section I used the following datasets:
    - P11-1000-Startups.xlsx
  - Use cases:
    - I have been approached by a Venture Capital Fund where the board of directors are currently reviewing 1000 potentially interesting startups and deciding on which to invest in based on the following criterions:
      -  High revenue (2015)
      -  Low expenses (2015)

- Section 3:
  - In this section I used the following datasets:
    - P11-Coal-Terminal.xlsx
  - Use cases:
    - I have been hired by a Coal Terminal to assess which of their Coal Reclaimer machines need maintenance in the upcoming month. These machines run literally 24/7 for 365 days a year and every minute of downtime equates to millions of dollars lost revenue thus the importance of this task. Currently, the Coal Terminal follows the following criterion:
      - A reclaimer-type machine needs maintenance when within the previous month there was at least one 8-hour period when the average idle capacity was over 10%. Where idle capcity = (Actual Tonnage - Normal Capacity)/Nominal Capacity.
    - My task is to find out which of the 5 machines exceeded the 10% mark and create a report for executive stakeholders.
